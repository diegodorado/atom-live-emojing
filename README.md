# Live Emojing

Live-emojing is a Livecoding technique I developed with the intention of including the audience in the performance. Spectators input  patterns in an intuitive manner by sending series of **emojis** via social networks.

You can find an in-depth explanation [here](http://diegodorado.github.io/works/live-emojing/)

This  plugin allows you to enhance your livecoding performance by adding an audience-emojis-participation to it.

## Installation

Install this package to Atom using through the settings page or by running

```bash
apm install live-emojing
